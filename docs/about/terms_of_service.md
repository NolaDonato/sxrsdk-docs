By using the SXR SDK Project website, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.

Here is the basic idea:


* Do not violate anyone's intellectual property or post anyone else's copyrighted or confidential material you do not have permission to use.
* Do not post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, illegal, etc.
* Do not post spam.
* Do not post too many meta-links and tags; too many will not be accepted. If you try to boost your SEO, that is an abuse of the system.
* Do not post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but do not mention how to buy it every single time.
* Do not launch into personal attacks. You are not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
* Tone down foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more impressive.

The SXR SDK Project is providing a framework for discussion and user generated information to expand the knowledge base of SXR SDK-related information.

We recognize there may be inaccurate information reflected in this website; users should understand that something that appears on the SXR SDK Project website does not mean the SXR SDK Project has vetted or endorsed that content.

The SXR SDK Project reserves the right to take down anything posted on this website for the above or other reasons. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use this website. Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from website administrators. A second violation will result in the removal of your user account.
