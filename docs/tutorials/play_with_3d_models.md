##Overview

Now that you've learned how to apply the material to the VR app with the SXR SDK, we are going to learn how to play with 3D model.

##Create Project
Create an SXR project by copying the [template project](https://github.com/sxrsdk/sxrsdk-demos/tree/master/template/SXRApplication) 

Perform the following steps to make sure your project runs correctly

1. (if developing for Gear VR) Copy your [Oculus signature file](https://developer.oculus.com/osig/) to `app/src/main/assets` folder.
1. Change the `applicationId` in `build.gradle` to a unique name to avoid naming conflict when you test the app later
1. Change the `app_name` in `res/values/strings.xml` to avoid confusion when you debug the app.

## Intro

Often times when we develop VR applications, we need to show complex 3D models. For example a plane, a castle or even an earth. We're going to learn how to achieve it with the SXR SDK

Before we start, we need to have a 3D model file. Here is the [3D T-rex model](/images/trex_mesh.fbx) with [texture](/images/trex_tex_diffuse.png) we're going to use for this tutorial. You can preview them in [FBX Review](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/fbx-review). 

You can use your own 3D models, just make sure it is one of the following file formats:

* OBJ
* FBX
* Collada(.dae)
* X3D
* All formats supported by [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/main_features_formats.html)



## How to load 3D models

The first step is to place it correctly. Please make sure to copy the files to the following path.

1. Copy `trex_mesh.fbx` into `app/src/main/assets`
1. Copy `trex_tex_diffuse.png` into `app/src/main/assets`

After copying the 3D model files, we can use `GVRAssetLoader` class to load them, it is accessible from the context by calling `GVRContext.getAssetLoader()`

Using the following code to load the fbx file and texture 
```java
GVRMesh dinoMesh = gvrContext.getAssetLoader().loadMesh(
	new GVRAndroidResource(gvrContext, "trex_mesh.fbx")
);

GVRTexture dinoTexture = gvrContext.getAssetLoader().loadTexture(
	new GVRAndroidResource(gvrContext, "trex_tex_diffuse.png")
);
```

!!!note
    Loading methods have `Future` in its API such as `loadFutureTexture` is deprecated

After 3D model and texture both loaded, we can add them to the scene with a scene object
```java
    GVRSceneObject dinoObj = new GVRSceneObject(gvrContext, dinoMesh, dinoTexture);

    dinoObj.getTransform().setPosition(0,0,-10);
    dinoObj.getTransform().rotateByAxis(-90, 1f, 0f, 0f);
    gvrContext.getMainScene().addSceneObject(dinoObj);

```

!!!note
    We create `GVRSceneObject` instead of use `AssetLoader.loadModel()` because `loadModel()` require fbx files to have correct path to texture file which a lot of 3D modeling software failed to produce.


Build and run the app, you should be able to see a T-Rex!

## Work with 3D modeling tools
Fbx is the recommended format for the SXR SDK. Currently, all major 3D modeling tools support exporting to FBX format.
